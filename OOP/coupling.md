## Component Coupling

- depicts how each of your components within your system relate to one another

Imagine you are driving in your car when suddenly you get a flat tire.  
Now, in order to replace it ,you just have to detach the defunct tyre from the rim.  
The point is, you donâ€™t have to dismantle your steering wheel or a gauge in order to get to the affected tyre.
In other words, your car components are loosely coupled . They work together to make the car work properly but their functionality does not directly depend upon external factors.
Each such component is only responsible for its own tasks.
