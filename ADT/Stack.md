# Stack - Abstract Data Structure 

## What it is ?

- a stack is simply a concept; an idea that enables the arrangment of data in linear sequence.
- storage & retrieval of the dataset strictly abides by the LIFO principle
- the principle dictaes the crucial design constraint, and that is only ever  permissable to alter the top of the stack. In other words,    LAST ITEM IN --> FIRST ITEM OUT


## Where is the benefit/ use cases ?

- Imposing LIFO constraint establishes controlled data access
- Support for UNDO / REDO actions 
-  JavaScript CallStack uses stack to manage and thread through various invocation contexts  - the topmost is the currently active context
- Reversing a Sequence of data ,for instance, a string reversal can be implemented using stacks 
- Browser History can be thought of as a series of stackframes
