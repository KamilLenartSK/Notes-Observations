#THE BOX MODEL notes
 
## WHAT 

-box model dictates composition of the page
-in CSS, every HTML element is visually represented as a rectangular box 
- this way, we are able to alter elements' properties with "relative" ease

We may control:
  1. SIZE of the element
  2. WIDTH of the element
  3. HEIGHT of the element
  4. POSITION of the element 
  5. BACKGROUND of the element
  6. MARGIN between two elements
  7. PADDING of the element's box
  8. BORDER of the element 
  9. OUTLINE of the element
